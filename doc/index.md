# Introduction to DAOS

The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open-source
object store designed from the ground up for massively distributed Non
Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage of next-generation NVM
technology, like Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVM express (NVMe),
while presenting a key-value storage interface on top of commodity
hardware that provides features, such as, transactional non-blocking
I/O, advanced data protection with self-healing, end-to-end data
integrity, fine-grained data control, and elastic storage, to optimize
performance and cost.

The included document versions are associated with DAOS v0.9.
