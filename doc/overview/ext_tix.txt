We need to be responsive to these initial POCs. They need tracked and responded to.
A process need established to process the request and parse out the tix to responsible EMs and track the tix through the process (Craig).
Verify closure on tix and appropriate response.
Triage Channel to prioritize external tix
Wiki to establish how to submit tix
HP has been told to email their ticket to Johann directly (blocking only) - General questions are to be mailed to the group (onboarding Wiki for access).
Can we close the ability to create issues in Github? (Scott K) - Yes. Question is if requesting access to Jira too high a bar? How to tell them how to request an account? Brian can close. Lets wait until we find how difficult requests are to approve. In the interim, monitor github issues.
Do external users have read access to ALLÂ Jira tix? Is this intended? Private projects will be created at the appropriate time.
We need codenames for external customers/tix for sortability and to conceal customer identity - NO
Triage channel to be created. Use the channel to create a rapid response.
